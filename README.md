# TLS: Flutter Cross Platform Application integrated with All Of the Fully Functional GCP Serverless APIs and User Tracking with Google Analytics. 
## Solution Description: Alpha White Label Lead Generator
### Industry: Fin-Tech

This is **Final Phase** of *The Last Stand*, that contains working and deployable code for a Flutter Cross Platform Application integrated with All Of the Fully Functional GCP Serverless APIs and User Tracking with Google Analytics, built by integrating [TLS1](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TLS1/README.md), [TLS2](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TLS2/README.md) and [TLS3](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TLS3/README.md).

### Tech Stack
- Tech Stack of [TLS1](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TLS1/README.md).
- Tech Stack of [TLS2](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TLS2/README.md).
- Tech Stack of [TLS3](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TLS3/README.md).

### Requirement Specifications:
- Integrate [TLS1](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TLS1/README.md), [TLS2](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TLS2/README.md) and [TLS3](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TLS3/README.md) to create Flutter Cross Platform Application integrated with All Of the Fully Functional GCP Serverless APIs and User Tracking with Google Analytics.

### Solution Constraints:
- Integrating Flutter application with Google Analytics [TLS1](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TLS1/README.md) is optional to proceed to the next stage. However, the solution that integrates [TLS1](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TLS1/README.md), will be given preference irrespective of submission sequence between non-[TLS1](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TLS1/README.md) and [TLS1](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TLS1/README.md).

### Tools to use/avoid
As described in [TLS1](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TLS1/README.md), [TLS2](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TLS2/README.md) and [TLS3](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TLS3/README.md).

### Test Cases - Applicable for Web, Android and iOS App.
As described in [TLS1](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TLS1/README.md), [TLS2](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TLS2/README.md) and [TLS3](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TLS3/README.md).

### Deliverables
- All relevant deliverables described in [TLS1](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TLS1/README.md), [TLS2](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TLS2/README.md) and [TLS3](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TLS3/README.md) applicable to this final phase of *The Last Stand*.
