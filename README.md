# TLS2: Flutter Cross Platform Application integrated with Fully Functional GCP Serverless User APIs. 
## Solution Description: Alpha White Label Lead Generator
### Industry: Fin-Tech

This is **Part-2** of *The Last Stand*, that contains working and deployable code built by integrating the Front End Flutter App from *The Hobbit's Journey* [THJ](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/edit/THJ/README.md) with the fully functional GCP Serverless User APIs from *Through the Looking Glass* [TLG](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/edit/TLG/README.md).

### Tech Stack
- Tech Stack of [THJ](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/edit/THJ/README.md).
- Tech Stack of [TLG](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/edit/TLG/README.md).

### Requirement Specifications:
- Integrate [THJ](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/edit/THJ/README.md) and [TLG](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/edit/TLG/README.md) to create Flutter Cross Platform Application that integrates with fully funtional GCP Serverless User APIs.

### Solution Constraints:
- Only User APIs are integrated with Flutter app.

### Tools to use/avoid
As described in [THJ](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/edit/THJ/README.md) and [TLG](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/edit/TLG/README.md).

### Test Cases - Applicable for Web, Android and iOS App.
| Test No | Test Name | Test Description | Test Data |  Test Steps | Expected Results |
| ----------- | ----------- |----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1 | Access the application | Access the applocation  | None | Landing Screen is presented to the user, interact with the screen, click Wallet Connect Button | Result Screen is shown with Success Message. *Note: All tests for [THJ](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/edit/THJ/README.md) with valid details are applicable, except that tests with any dummy details to mock up a failure scenario, such as usage of a@a.com resulting in failure are not applicalble* |

### Deliverables
- Same as [THJ](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/edit/THJ/README.md) and [TLG](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/edit/TLG/README.md), with an addition that the Flutter app is fully intergrated with fully funtional GCP Serverless User APIs.
