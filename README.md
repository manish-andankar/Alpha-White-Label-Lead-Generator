# TLG: GCP Serverless APIs integrated With GCP Cloud Spanner Database for White Label Lead Generator App.
## Solution Description: Alpha White Label Lead Generator
### Industry: Fin-Tech

This is **Final Phase** of *Through the Looking Glass*, that contains working and deployable code and final software package for APIs integrated with GCP Cloud Spanner built and deployed using modern serverless paradigm on GCP.

### Tech Stack
- Tech Stack of [TLG1](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TLG1/README.md).
- Tech Stack of [TLG2](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TLG2/README.md).

### Requirement Specifications:
- Integrate [TLG1](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TLG1/README.md) and [TLG2](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TLG2/README.md) to create the final GCP Serverless APIs that interact with GCP Cloud Spanner Database for White Label Lead Generator App.

### Solution Constraints:
- GCP Serverless APIs are fully integrated With GCP Cloud Spanner Database to provide restful, scalable and secure mechanism for data interactions.

### Tools to use/avoid
As described in [TLG1](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TLG1/README.md) and [TLG2](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TLG2/README.md).

### Deliverables
- Completed Code of Integrated GCP Serverless APIs with GCP Cloud Spanner Database that combines [TLG1](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TLG1/README.md) and [TLG2](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TLG2/README.md) is checked in to the repository with a *unique folder* that indicates your contribution. It is the *parent* folder for all deliverables.
- GCP Serverless APIs deployed on GCP and link shared in a text file checked in with the name *web_api_urls* under the folder *deliverables* within the *unique folder*.
- Deployment instructions for the integrated API solution, are documented with supporting materials and assets in the *deployment guide* folder.
- Documentation & Video Demo under the folder *documentation* within the *unique folder*.
