# TLG1: GCP Serverless APIs for White Label Lead Generator App.
## Solution Description: Alpha White Label Lead Generator
### Industry: Fin-Tech

This is **Part-1** of *Through the Looking Glass*, that contains working and deployable code and final software package for APIs built and deployed using modern serverless paradigm on GCP.

### Tech Stack
The Alpha White Label Lead Generation APIs utilizes the following technologies and frameworks:
- GCP API Gateway: A Fully managed gateway for serverless workloads offered by GCP. Visit https://cloud.google.com/api-gateway to learn more.
- GCP Cloud Functions: Helps run code as FaaS in a serverless environment. Visit https://cloud.google.com/functions to learn more.
- GitHub: A web-based platform for version control and collaboration that allows developers to host and review code, manage projects, and build software alongside millions of other developers.
