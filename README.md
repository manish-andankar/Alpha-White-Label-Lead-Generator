*The Mission:* **Build a PRODUCTION READY White Label Lead Generator App that runs on Web, Android and iOS platform, and captures user information, their preference to subscribe for updates and their SOL Address after verifying their identity by connecting to Phantom Wallet. Simple, but NOT EASY**

Each milestone in the game creates a building block for the next milestone.
Each step has its separate github branch. These steps has dependencies, as shown in the network diagram above.

The branches are as follows:
1. [THJ1: Front-End Cross-Platform Flutter Application](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/THJ1/README.md)
2. [THJ2: User Interface Design and User Experience](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/THJ2/README.md)
3. [THJ: Flutter Cross Platform Application integrated with User Interface Design and User Experience](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/THJ/README.md) *Milestone: The Hobbit's Journey*
4. [TLG1: GCP Serverless APIs for White Label Lead Generator App](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TLG1/README.md)
5. [TLG2: GCP Cloud Spanner database for White Label Lead Generator App](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TLG2/README.md)
6. [TLG: GCP Serverless APIs integrated With GCP Cloud Spanner Database for White Label Lead Generator App](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TLG/README.md) *Milestone: Through the Looking Glass*
7. [TLS1: User Tracking And Analytics using Google Analytics](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TLS1/README.md)
8. [TLS2: Flutter Cross Platform Application integrated with Fully Functional GCP Serverless User APIs](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TLS2/README.md)
9. [TLS3: Flutter Cross Platform Application integrated with Fully Functional GCP Serverless Offer (Coundown) APIs](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TLS3/README.md)
10. [TLS: Flutter Cross Platform Application integrated with All Of the Fully Functional GCP Serverless APIs and User Tracking with Google Analytics](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TLS/README.md) *Milestone: The Last Stand*
11. [TPR: Phantom Wallet Connect for White Label Lead Generator to capture Sol Address for the User authentication](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TPR/README.md) *Milestone: The Phoenix's Rebirth*
12. [TFC: Alpha White Label Lead Generator (Release Candidate)](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/TFC/README.md) *Milestone: The Final Convergence*

*The Flow:*
The user accesses the app, provides user information and Connect to Wallet. Upon successful connection, the SOL Addres along with the user information and opt-in for updates, and stores it in GCP Cloud Spanner DB via UserIno API. The Countdown Timer starts going down through a sample API call.

*The Rules:* 
1. As a developer, you may choose to go solo, or team-up with other developers. Register yourself as Developer by visiting [HackGPT.tech](https://www.hackgpt.tech/).
2. Each deverloper/team must create and submit their work in a folder that has *unique folder name* in the branch that corresponds to each step in the game. Developers may choose to have their own unique folder names based on their preference.
3. Fork The Fork:

  Fork the Fork (**UNCHECK** the checkbox that says - clone only dev) to ensure that your fork has all 12 branches.
  Make sure that your Fork is Public! It will be Public by default, but ensure that it is the case. 
4. Submit the work in respective branch.
5. Collaborate with others to earn more, and learn more!!
