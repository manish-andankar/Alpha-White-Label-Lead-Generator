# TLS2: Flutter Cross Platform Application integrated with Fully Functional GCP Serverless User APIs. 
## Solution Description: Alpha White Label Lead Generator
### Industry: Fin-Tech

This is **Part-2** of *The Last Stand*, that contains working and deployable code built by integrating the Front End Flutter App from *The Hobbit's Journey* [THJ](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/edit/THJ/README.md) with the fully functional GCP Serverless User APIs from *Through the Looking Glass* [TLG](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/edit/TLG/README.md).

### Tech Stack
- Tech Stack of [THJ](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/edit/THJ/README.md).
- Tech Stack of [TLG](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/edit/TLG/README.md).

### Requirement Specifications:
- Integrate [THJ](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/edit/THJ/README.md) and [TLG](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/edit/TLG/README.md) to create Flutter Cross Platform Application that integrates with fully funtional GCP Serverless User APIs.

### Solution Constraints:
- Only User APIs are integrated with Flutter app.

### Tools to use/avoid
As described in [THJ](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/edit/THJ/README.md) and [TLG](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/edit/TLG/README.md).

### Deliverables
