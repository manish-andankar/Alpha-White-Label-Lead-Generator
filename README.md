# THJ2: User Interface Design and User Experience
## Solution Description: Alpha White Label Lead Generator

### Industry: Fin-Tech

This is **Part-2** of *The Hobbit's Journey*, that contains working prototype of user interface that becomes part of the final application that creates a responsive and rich user experiences.

### Tech Stack
The working prototype of user interface utilizes the following technologies and frameworks:
- Figma: A collaborative interface design tool. Visit https://www.figma.com/ to learn more.
- GitHub: A web-based platform for version control and collaboration that allows developers to host and review code, manage projects, and build software alongside millions of other developers.

### Requirement Specifications:
- The Landing and Result screens is required to be built, with user inputs and user experience as described in the README.md file at [THJ1](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/THJ1/README.md)
- The mockup and necessary digital assets and links will be provided soon.
- Use Figma and your creativity to create a working prototype showing the Responsive Landing and Result Screens to achieve desired performance and user exprience.

### Solution Constraints:
- Working prototype need to showcase all test cases described in the README.md file at [THJ1](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/THJ1/README.md)

### Deliverables
- Responsive Figma prototype links, other extracted artefacts such as css (if any) that will be used in [THJ1](https://github.com/manish-andankar/Alpha-White-Label-Lead-Generator/blob/THJ1/README.md) to integrate this design into the Front-End application built in Flutter.
- The prototype links are shared in a text file with the name *app_prototype_url* and other artefact files (if any) checked in under the folder *deliverables* within your *unique folder*.
- Documentation & Video Demo under the folder *documentation* within your *unique folder*.
